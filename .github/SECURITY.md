# Security policy

## Supported versions

We release patches for the latest minor version. Older minors are not officially supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately**:

- **Preferred:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/un-rust/package-name/security/advisories/new) (private by default).
- Or email the maintainers (see [FUNDING.yml](./.github/FUNDING.yml) or repo profile for contact).

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. We will acknowledge and work on a fix, and credit you in the advisory if you wish.
